# Grocery Reminder Mobile App

# Purpose
The purpose of this app is to create a mobile application that will remind me of the items I need and when I need them. Occasionally, I will forget about the items I need to get, so creating this app will help me remember what I need when I go shopping. Currently, I plan to only create this app for groceries from supermarkets around the Los Angeles area. Depending on the course of this project, I may expand the app to other items.

# Tech Stack
Will use React native, HTML, CSS, Javascript to create the mobile app.
